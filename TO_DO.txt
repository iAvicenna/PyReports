- add to example something about tables
- in Containers, _has and _items is quite convoluted and unnecessarily complex
  something simpler!
- can you move most of the formatting to beatiful soup I wonder? try its formatting
first without changing anything and see what it does.

- currently it is not possible to put multiple objects into a single Tab without
using something like Grid to contain them all. So maybe an object called Div
could be useful

- tab inside grid inside tab seems problematic

Txt(f'<strong>{inde}</strong>- ' + experiment['name'] + '<br>')

does not seem to add the br at the end

the following does not display quite correctly

Txt('''
    1- Two groups of points are generated randomly (first group between
       100-200 points and the second 50-150) within a grid of sides 10

    2- A noise is added to their distances with mean 0 and std 0.7.
       These will be called the observed distances.

    3- Row and Column avidities are added with mean 0 and std 2.

    4- Coordinates are fitted to the distances including avidity parameters
       in optimization.

also shouldnt these display correctly when formatted=False, but they dont?


In things like below the tabs at the beginning dont appear even in formatted

         - The main source file is the h5/data/H5.fasta in ACORG database
         - This file usually contains multiple records for antigens. In most cases most of these records contain many undetermined aminoacids so those are dropped.
         - From the remaining antigens there is usually only one antigen which matches in name and year details or if multiple they have identical sequences. It is not always True that the passage information exists in the ids of the sequences though. So one should keep that in  mind. Following list shows antigen names from the map on the left and to which record it was matched in the file above. Where there was a disambuguity it is noted next to the match.
