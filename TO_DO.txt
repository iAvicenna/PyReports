formatted vs raw, shouldnt raw be pre?

Txt(f'<strong>{inde}</strong>- ' + experiment['name'] + '<br>')

does not seem to add the br at the end

the following does not display quite correctly

Txt('''
    1- Two groups of points are generated randomly (first group between
       100-200 points and the second 50-150) within a grid of sides 10
    
    2- A noise is added to their distances with mean 0 and std 0.7.
       These will be called the observed distances.
       
    3- Row and Column avidities are added with mean 0 and std 2.
    
    4- Coordinates are fitted to the distances including avidity parameters
       in optimization.
       
    5- Coordinates are also fitted to the distances not including avidity
       parameters in optimization.
       
    6- Comparison of fitted vs added avidities and observed vs
       fitted distances are made.

    So in each column the given plots are the following:
        
    1- Fitted Row Avidities vs Added Row Avidities
    
    2- Fitted Column Avidities vs Added Column Avidities
    
    3- Error in Observed distance vs fitted distances (when avidity parameters
       are included in optimziation). Red line indicates the expected
       distribution given the noise in the observed distances
       
    4- Error in Observed distance vs fitted distances (when avidity parameters

also shouldnt these display correctly when formatted=False, but they dont?


In things like below the tabs at the beginning dont appear even in formatted
